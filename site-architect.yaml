  This architect builds a simple static site for Beehive and sets up S3 deployment.

  The site lives in a new site/ directory within the beehive repo.
  Tech stack: TypeScript, React (Create React App or Vite), minimal dependencies.

  Design:
  - Simple, single-page site. Dark background, clean typography.
  - "bh" logo in the top-left corner (matching the TUI's bee-yellow #FEE100 accent).
  - Center-aligned content showing how to use beehive in a simple, effective way.
  - Generous code blocks with click-to-copy functionality.
  - Show how to install via Homebrew:
      brew tap sanjeev-/beehive
      brew install beehive
  - Show basic usage commands (beehive session, beehive architect, etc.)
  - That's it — extremely simple landing page. No routing, no navbar, no footer clutter.

  Deployment:
  - GitHub Actions workflow (same pattern as bitbook/fabric):
    - Trigger: workflow_dispatch (manual)
    - Build: npm ci && npm run build
    - Deploy: aws s3 sync ./build s3://${BEEHIVE_SITE_BUCKET} --delete
    - AWS credentials from GitHub secrets: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - Region: us-east-1
  - Do NOT create the actual S3 bucket or CloudFront distribution.
  - Instead, include clear instructions in the PR description for what infra changes
    the user needs to make (create S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled,
    optional CloudFront distribution, bucket policy for public read).

  Principles:
  - Keep it dead simple. One page, no dependencies beyond React and a syntax highlighter.
  - Use a lightweight syntax highlighting library (e.g., prism-react-renderer or highlight.js)
    for the code blocks.
  - Click-to-copy: use navigator.clipboard.writeText() with a small copy icon/button on each block.
  - Responsive: should look good on mobile too, but desktop-first.
  - The site/ directory should be self-contained with its own package.json, tsconfig, etc.
  - Use Vite + React (faster, simpler than CRA) unless there's a reason not to.

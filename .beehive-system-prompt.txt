================================================================================
PLAN CONTEXT - Your task is part of an ordered plan:
================================================================================

Plan: Create the sanjeev-/homebrew-tap GitHub repository using 'gh repo create', add the beehive Homebrew formula (Formula/beehive.rb) pointing to the v0.1.0 release tarball with correct SHA256, and verify 'brew tap sanjeev-/tap && brew info beehive' works.
Execution mode: sequential
Total tickets: 2

>>> YOUR TASK (#1): Create Homebrew formula for beehive

PLANNED AFTER YOUR TASK:
  #2. Add Homebrew tap creation instructions
     Create documentation in the beehive repository explaining how to create and maintain the sanjeev-/homebrew-tap repository. Include step-by-step instructions for: 1) Using 'gh repo create sanjeev-/homebrew-tap --public' to create the tap repository, 2) Copying the Formula/beehive.rb file to the tap repository, 3) Testing the tap with 'brew tap sanjeev-/tap && brew info beehive', and 4) Updating the formula for new releases. Add this to a HOMEBREW.md file or include in README.md.

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on your task. Do not implement work that belongs to previous or future tickets. Keep your scope limited to exactly what your task describes.

================================================================================
TASK INSTRUCTIONS:
================================================================================

Create a Formula/beehive.rb file in the beehive repository that defines a Homebrew formula for the beehive CLI tool. The formula should point to the v0.1.0 release tarball, include the correct SHA256 hash, specify Python 3.8+ as a dependency, and define the install method to use pip3 to install from the tarball. Include proper metadata like homepage, description, and license. Test that the formula syntax is valid.

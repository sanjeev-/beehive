PLAN CONTEXT - Your task is part of an ordered plan:
================================================================================

Plan: Build a simple static landing page for Beehive in a new site/ directory. Vite + React + TypeScript. Single page with: "bh" logo (bee-yellow #FEE100) in top-left corner, dark background, center-aligned content explaining how to install and use beehive. Code blocks with click-to-copy (navigator.clipboard API) showing: brew install, basic CLI commands (session create, architect plan, architect watch). Use prism-react-renderer for syntax highlighting. Add a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy-site.yaml) that builds the site and deploys via aws s3 sync to an S3 bucket, following the same pattern as the fabric project. The workflow should use workflow_dispatch trigger, AWS credentials from secrets, and us-east-1 region. Do NOT create actual AWS infrastructure — instead document the required infra setup (S3 bucket with static hosting, bucket policy, optional CloudFront) in the PR description.
Execution mode: sequential
Total tickets: 4

COMPLETED BEFORE YOUR TASK:
  #1. [TicketStatus.MERGED] Create Vite + React + TypeScript project structure in site/ directory
     Set up a new Vite + React + TypeScript project in the site/ subdirectory. Create package.json with dependencies: react, react-dom, @types/react, @types/react-dom, vite, @vitejs/plugin-react, typescript, prism-react-renderer. Set up vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, and src/ directory structure with index.html, main.tsx, App.tsx, and App.css. Configure build output to dist/ directory. The project should be completely self-contained within the site/ directory.

  #2. [TicketStatus.MERGED] Build single-page landing site with dark theme and bh logo
     Implement the main landing page in src/App.tsx with: dark background (#1a1a1a or similar), clean typography, "bh" logo in top-left corner using bee-yellow color #FEE100. Center-aligned content area with heading "Beehive" and brief description of the tool. Implement responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile. Style with CSS modules or styled-components, keeping the design minimal and clean.

>>> YOUR TASK (#3): Add installation and usage code blocks with click-to-copy

PLANNED AFTER YOUR TASK:
  #4. Add GitHub Actions workflow for S3 deployment
     Create .github/workflows/deploy-site.yaml following the fabric project pattern. Workflow should: trigger on workflow_dispatch (manual), run on ubuntu-latest, use Node.js 18, cd into site/ directory, run npm ci && npm run build, deploy using aws s3 sync ./dist s3://${BEEHIVE_SITE_BUCKET} --delete. Use AWS credentials from GitHub secrets (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) and us-east-1 region. Include comprehensive PR description documenting required AWS infrastructure: S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled, public read bucket policy, optional CloudFront distribution setup.

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on your task. Do not implement work that belongs to previous or future tickets. Keep your scope limited to exactly what your task describes.

TASK INSTRUCTIONS:
================================================================================

Create code block components using prism-react-renderer for syntax highlighting. Implement click-to-copy functionality using navigator.clipboard.writeText() API with small copy icons/buttons. Add code blocks showing: 1) Homebrew installation (brew tap sanjeev-/beehive && brew install beehive), 2) Basic CLI usage (beehive session create, beehive architect plan, beehive architect watch). Each code block should have hover states and visual feedback when copied. Handle clipboard API errors gracefully with fallback.

DELIVERABLE - Complete these steps when done:
================================================================================

When you have completed the task:
1. git add -A && git commit -m "<descriptive message>"
2. git push -u origin HEAD
3. gh pr create --fill --base plan/build-a-simple-static-landing-page-for-beehive-in--622bb49c
4. gh pr merge --squash
5. Print the PR URL as the last line of output
These steps are MANDATORY. You must commit, push, create a PR, and merge it before finishing.
